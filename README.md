  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>The password generator is designed to generate strong passwords that are difficult to guess or crack. However, it's important to note that no password can ever be completely secure, and that additional security measures (such as two-factor authentication) may be necessary to fully protect sensitive accounts and data.</p>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  <p>To use the password generator, simply open the <code>index.html</code> file in a web browser. The user will be prompted to specify the desired length of the password, as well as which character sets to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols).</p>
  <p>Once the user has specified the desired criteria, the application will generate a strong password that meets those criteria.</p>
